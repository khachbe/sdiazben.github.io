		</h1>
		<div id="tree"></div>
		<div id="map"></div>
		<p1>The map shows the amount of refugees that were settled from Bhutan in 2017 in different states and towns of the USA.
			Interaction will be added later in order to showcase more countries and traverse different years.

			On the other hand, the tree shows the distribution of the entries within the household, i.e. how many entries to refer to the applicant him/herself and how many to his/her family members.
